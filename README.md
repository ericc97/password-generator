# Password Generator

If you need a new password and security is your main concern then look no further. This password generator allows you to decide whether you want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, number, and symbols to your password. You can choose a password length between 8-128 characters. There's also a feature to copy your new password directly to your clip board, no ctrl C needed!

## How to use

first decide how long you want your password to be. Next decide what type of characters you want to include in your password. Finally git generate password and there you have it. After that just click the nifty copy to clipboard button and you're all set.
